# AlexaSkills

This is a backend in Golang that allows to manipulate Alexa Skills, inspired by **Henry Lee**'s book [*Voice User Ibterface*](https://www.amazon.com/Voice-User-Interface-Projects-voice-enabled-ebook/dp/B07B3RB8NH).

You can import the Skill [cooking.json](https://github.com/saphoooo/AlexaSkills/blob/master/Alexa%20Skill%20Export/cooking.json) and run the backend localy with [fresh](https://github.com/gravityblast/fresh), [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and [redis](https://redis.io/).

I recently added Dialogflow too: you can import the agent [ZguingousKitchen.zip](https://github.com/saphoooo/AlexaSkills/blob/master/Dialogflow%20Export/ZguingousKitchen.zip) and run it with the same backend.
