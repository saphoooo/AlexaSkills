# AlexaSkills

Work in progress...

## Goal

This is a backend in Golang that allows to manipulate Alexa Skills, inspired by Henry Lee's book *Voice User Ibterface*.

You can import the Skill [cooking.json](https://github.com/saphoooo/AlexaSkills/blob/master/Alexa%20Skill%20Export/cooking.json) and run the backend localy with [fresh](https://github.com/gravityblast/fresh), [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and [redis](https://redis.io/).
